# BentleyOttmann

Problem Statement:
Devise and implement a sweep algorithm to perform the following task: The input is a set S of n line segments in the plane. The algorithm is to determine if the union of these segments is a tree or not (i.e., in the arrangement of the segments, is there a single face, the face at infinity?) An algorithm similar to the Bentley-Ottmann sweep should be possible. To simplify matters, you can use data structures from an appropriate library, or implement trivial, naive data structures. Try to animate the algorithm so it can be viewed and understood by the class. 

Assumptions:
Assume no 3 points are colinear, no 2 endpoints lie on a horizontal/vertical line
